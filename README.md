An exploratory dabble with Elixir and OTP by way of a lightweight distributed CI system.

TODO
====

* Handle test and deploy stages differently (test stages run all commands even on error)
* Report exit code of stages
* Queue jobs
* Provide event managers to stream command output
* Handle stalled jobs
* Allow configuration with YAML files
* Persistence layer
* Web front-end
* Run stages in directories and clean up
* Git/GitHub integration
* Distribution across nodes
* Probably lots more things I can't think of off the top of my head
